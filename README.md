Export your WhatsApp messages and convert them to Signal messages.



Short introduction to the code:

You'll need both your Android smartphone and a desktop with a Python terminal (I prefer Spyder but any one 
of them should work). If you have both of these, you should be able to follow the steps as indicated in the 
Python document (ConvertWhatsAppToSignal.py).

The idea is that you'll export your WhatsApp conversations to backup-files on your smartphone. Next you send 
these files to your desktop and put them all together in a folder. Then you can use the software to transform 
these files into SMSBackupAndRestore-files so that when you place these files back on your smartphone, 
SMSBackUpAndRestore will be able to import the files into your system-sms database. Lastly, you can use 
Signal's built-in tool to import your system-sms database into Signal's app. Now you should have all your 
WhatsApp messages in Signal.

This process is explained step-by-step in the Python document, so take a look at it before starting.

For Germans:

WhatsApp doesn't allow exporting chats in Germany so this is the next best thing as far as I know.
If you just want to save your chats and not necessarily export them to Signal however, then you can go to 
web.whatsapp.com, pick a conversation, scroll all the way to the top of the conversation and then right-click 
anywhere but the conversation and choose "save as...". The result of saving this is a webpage and a folder with 
the contents of that webpage. This will allow you to save your conversations as webpages on your desktop (it 
looks like a webpage when you open it, but it isn't actually on the internet, everything is stored on your 
computer). You'll need to do this separately for each conversation so it might be a bit time consuming if you 
have some large conversations that you'll have to scroll through (remember, you can use scroll-lock by clicking 
your scroll wheel and moving your mouse in the direction you want to scroll).
